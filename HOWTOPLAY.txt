HOW TO PLAY

USE THE KEYS TO MOVE INGLIP. INTERSECT THE CORRECT ANSWER PRECISELY THROUGH THE MIDDLE. THIS MIGHT TAKE SEVERAL TRIES. IF YOU INTERSECT THE CORRECT ANSWER AND YOU HADN'T LOST TOO MANY POINTS, YOU WILL BE TAKEN TO THE NEXT QUESTION. EVENTUALLY, YOU WILL REACH THE 'LEVEL UP' SCREEN. PRESS 'PAUSE' TO RESUME THE GAME. GAME PLAY WILL GET PROGRESSIVELY HARDER. IF YOU WISH TO RESTART THE GAME AT ANY POINT, YOU WILL HAVE TO EXIT THE GAME AND RE-OPEN IT. IF YOU SUCCEED, YOU WILL REACH A VICTORY SCREEN.
